# YOLOv8 Streamlit Detection & Tracking

This project is a real-time object detection and tracking application built using the YOLOv8 model and Streamlit. It allows users to detect and track multiple objects in video streams with a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8
- Multi-object tracking using ByteTrack and BoT-SORT algorithms
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- Supports live video streams and video file input

## Installation
